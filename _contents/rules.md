Before you sign up, you need to know that **we strictly enforce several lightweight [social rules](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Social-rules)**. In brief: racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, capitalist advocacy, &ldquo;brogrammer,&rdquo; &ldquo;manarchist,&rdquo; or any kind of similarly awful behavior will not be tolerated and you and your team will be immediately ejected from the game. This is judged at the sole discretion of the game organizer. Never take a learning opportunity away from another participant, no matter how smart you need everyone to think you are.

* Searching for quiz answers on your phone during the game is *allowed*. If you don&rsquo;t know it, search for it!
* No attacking the game infrastructure. If bugs or vulnerabilities are found, please alert the game organizers immediately.
* Absolutely no sabotaging of other teams, or in any way hindering their independent progress.
* Violations of the [social rules](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Social-rules) by any player will result in that player&rsquo;s team forfeiting the game.
