title: How does Hacker Trivia Night work?
---

Here&rsquo;s how the fundraiser works in a nutshell:

1. *Donors*: Kind-hearted people contribute funds to create a prize pool for each Hacker Trivia Night competition.  
    <small>(We run competitions as often as we can, given the donations we collect.)</small>
1. *Beneficiaries*: Local businesses or community organizations in need apply to become beneficiaries of an upcoming competition.  
    <small>(Applying is free but approval is subject to sensible restrictions. We don&rsquo;t have any interest in giving donors&rsquo; hard-earned cash to huge corporations or businesses that are anti-worker, anti-women, or just blatantly anti-justice.)</small>
1. *Players*: Anyone who wants to play can declare their beneficiary when they register their team.  
    <small>(Games are always free to play, are scored in real-time using an open source [Capture the Flag gaming system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security), and beginners are welcomed. Watch a short [demo]({% link static/images/screencapture.gif %}) to see what gameplay is like.)</small>

Prize money from the pool of collected donations is then divided and distrubted among the top-performing teams&rsquo;s declared beneficiaries. Choose your role for more information:

Beginners (&ldquo;newbies&rdquo;) are welcome and encouraged to play! You can&rsquo;t be l33t if you don&rsquo;t try!

Here&rsquo;s how to win money for your chosen beneficiary:

1. [Register](https://ctf.techlearningcollective.com/index.php?page=registration) on our game website:
    * Enter your name and an email address to identify yourself.
    * Form a team with others by entering additional names and email addresses at the time you register.  
        <small>(You can play if you are alone by making a team of one player.)</small>
    * Choose a team name, password, and emblem.  
        <small>(Give your team password to your teammates. Your teammates can then join you by logging in using the team name and the team password.)</small>
1. To win prize money for your beneficiary, you must declare a beneficiary at the time you register:
    * To declare a beneficiary, ensure that your team includes one &ldquo;player&rdquo; account bearing your beneficiary&rsquo;s name and email address.  
        <small>(You can declare more than one beneficiary, in which case your portion of any winnings will be evenly split among the beneficiaries you declared.)</small>
1. When the game starts, earn points by working with your teammates to find answers to the &ldquo;hacker trivia&rdquo; questions and solutions to the challenge puzzles:
    * Consider setting up a private chat room or video conference with your teammates ahead of time so that you can collaborate more effectively and earn more points faster.  
        <small>We recommend [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/) (or any of these [additional Jitsi Meet instances](https://framatalk.org/accueil/en/info/)).</small>
1. Compete against the other teams to score more points faster than they do, until the game clock expires.
    * You can sometimes earn bonus points simply by being the first team to solve a particular challenge.
    * Harder challenges are worth more points, but don&rsquo;t let another team overtake you simply by solving many easier challenges as you grind away on a difficult task! 
    * You can pay for hints with points you&rsquo;ve earned from solving previous challenges, but be mindful not to pay for more hints than you can afford!
1. The team with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner and claims the grand prize for their chosen beneficiary.
    * In the case of a tie, the faster team wins.

<summary><span>Beneficiaries</span></summary>

A beneficiary is any local business, non-profit group, or other organization who registers with us ahead of the game and is eligible to receive cash donations if their team(s) score highest in the game.

We require beneficiaries to register in order to ensure that donated funds go to those for whom the support is intended.

Hacker Trivia Night competitions are typically themed. For example, we may run a game &ldquo;to support food service workers,&rdquo; which means the selected beneficiaries will be organizations or local businesses in the food service sector.

You can apply to become a Hacker Trivia Night beneficiary at any time, regardless of the current game&rsquo;s theme.

When the game is over, if any teams competing on your behalf have won, we will send you a percentage of the total donated prize pool. The exact amount depends on the donations received from donors and the results of the game, of course.

Good samaritans such as yourself, your friends, your neighbors, and others donate to create a prize pool that will go to support the beneficiaries.

We use well-known crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe to keep donors updated and to help manage funds in a trusted, transparent manner.
