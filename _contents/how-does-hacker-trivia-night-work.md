title: How does Hacker Trivia Night work?
---

Here&rsquo;s how the fundraiser works in a nutshell:

1. *Donors*: Kind-hearted people contribute funds to create a prize pool for each Hacker Trivia Night competition.  
    <small>(We run competitions as often as we can, given the donations we collect.)</small>
1. *Beneficiaries*: Local businesses or community organizations in need apply to become beneficiaries of an upcoming competition.  
    <small>(Applying is free but approval is subject to sensible restrictions. We don&rsquo;t have any interest in giving donors&rsquo; hard-earned cash to huge corporations or businesses that are anti-worker, anti-women, or just blatantly anti-justice.)</small>
1. *Players*: Anyone who wants to play can declare their beneficiary when they register their team.  
    <small>(Games are always free to play, are scored in real-time using an open source [Capture the Flag gaming system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security), and beginners are welcomed. Watch a short [demo]({% link static/images/screencapture.gif %}) to see what gameplay is like.)</small>

Prize money from the pool of collected donations is then divided and distrubted among the top-performing teams&rsquo;s declared beneficiaries. Read on for more information.

1. Players register on our game website, which is an [open source Capture the Flag (CTF) gaming system](https://github.com/tech-learning-collective/fbctf), and optionally form teams.
1. Each team must declare a beneficiary with the game organizers to be able to claim a cash prize.
1. When the game starts, teammates work together to answer &ldquo;hacker trivia&rdquo; questions in the form of quizzes and puzzles that test the player&rsquo;s cybersecurity skillz. (Beginners are welcome and encouraged to play! You can&rsquo;t be l33t if you don&rsquo;t try!)
1. Teams compete to score points as quickly as possible by answering quizzes and completing puzzles faster than other teams.
1. The team with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner and claims the grand prize for their chosen beneficiary.

<summary><span>Donors</span></summary>

Good samaritans such as yourself, your friends, your neighbors, and others donate to create a prize pool that will go to support the beneficiaries.

We use well-known crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe to keep donors updated and to help manage funds in a trusted, transparent manner.

<summary><span>Beneficiaries</span></summary>

A beneficiary is any local business, non-profit group, or other organization who registers with us ahead of the game and is eligible to receive cash donations if their team(s) score highest in the game.

We require beneficiaries to register in order to ensure that donated funds go to those for whom the support is intended.

Hacker Trivia Night competitions are typically themed. For example, we may run a game &ldquo;to support food service workers,&rdquo; which means the selected beneficiaries will be organizations or local businesses in the food service sector.

You can apply to become a Hacker Trivia Night beneficiary at any time, regardless of the current game&rsquo;s theme.

When the game is over, if any teams competing on your behalf have won, we will send you a percentage of the total donated prize pool. The exact amount depends on the donations received from donors and the results of the game, of course.
