title: How does Hacker Trivia Night work?
---

Here&rsquo;s how the fundraiser works in a nutshell:

1. *Donors*: Kind-hearted people contribute funds to create a prize pool for each Hacker Trivia Night competition.  
    <small>(We run competitions as often as we can, given the donations we collect.)</small>
1. *Beneficiaries*: Local businesses or community organizations in need [apply]({% link beneficiaries/apply/index.md %}#MainContent) to become beneficiaries of an upcoming competition.  
    <small>(Applying is free but approval is subject to sensible restrictions. We don&rsquo;t have any interest in giving donors&rsquo; hard-earned cash to huge corporations or businesses that are anti-worker, anti-women, or just blatantly anti-justice.)</small>
1. *Players*: Anyone who wants to play can [declare their beneficiary]({% link faq/index.md %}#how-do-i-choose-who-my-winnings-will-go-to) when they [register their team](https://ctf.techlearningcollective.com/index.php?page=registration).  
    <small>(Games are always free to play, are scored in real-time using an open source [Capture the Flag gaming system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security), and beginners are welcomed. Watch a short [demo]({% link static/images/screencapture.gif %}) to see what gameplay is like.)</small>

Prize money from the pool of collected donations is then divided and distrubted among the top-performing teams&rsquo;s declared beneficiaries. Choose your role for more information:

Here&rsquo;s how to win money for your chosen beneficiary:

1. [Register](https://ctf.techlearningcollective.com/index.php?page=registration) on our game website:
    * Enter your name and an email address to identify yourself.
    * Form a team with others by entering additional names and email addresses when you register.  
        <small>(You can play by yourself making a team of one player.)</small>
    * Choose a team name, password, and emblem.  
        <small>(Give your team password to your teammates. Your teammates can then join you by logging in using the team name and the team password.)</small>
1. [Declare a beneficiary]({% link faq/index.md %}#how-do-i-choose-who-my-winnings-will-go-to) when you register so that your earnings are donated to the group you want to support:
    * To declare a beneficiary, include one &ldquo;player&rdquo; account bearing your beneficiary&rsquo;s name and email address. *Double-check your spelling!*  
        <small>(You can declare more than one beneficiary, in which case your portion of any winnings will be evenly split among the beneficiaries you declared.)</small>
1. Earn points by working with your teammates to find answers to the &ldquo;hacker trivia&rdquo; questions and solutions to the challenge puzzles:
    * Consider setting up a private chat room or video conference with your teammates ahead of time so that you can collaborate more effectively and earn more points faster.  
        <small>We recommend [Jitsi Meet](https://meet.jit.si/) (or any of these [additional Jitsi Meet instances](https://framatalk.org/accueil/en/info/)).</small>
1. Compete against the other teams to score more points faster than they do before the game clock counts down to zero.
    * You can sometimes earn bonus points simply by being the first team to solve a particular challenge.
    * Harder challenges are worth more points, but don&rsquo;t let another team overtake you simply by solving many easier challenges as you grind away on a difficult task! 
    * You can pay for hints with points you&rsquo;ve earned from solving previous challenges, but be mindful not to pay for more hints than you can afford!
1. You win if your team has the most points when the game clock hits zero.
    * Winning teams earn their declared beneficiaries prizes in the form of cash donations.
    * In the case of a tied score, the team with the most correct answers wins.  
    <small>(If multiple teams are still tied, the team who answered those questions correctly the fastest will be declared the winner.)</small>

<summary><span>Beneficiaries</span></summary>

Beneficiaries are groups or organizations who are doing awesome things. Our definition of &ldquo;awesome&rdquo; is quite loose; beneficiaries can be any local businesses, non-profit group, or other organization that has registered with us and that we believe shares our pro-social values. Not sure if you qualify? Don&rsquo;t stress! [Applying]({% link beneficiaries/apply/index.md %}#MainContent) is free.

Here&rsquo;s how to get money by participating in Hacker Trivia Night:

1. [Apply]({% link beneficiaries/apply/index.md %}#MainContent) to become a Hacker Trivia Night beneficiary.
    * We require beneficiaries to register in order to ensure that donated funds go to those for whom the support is intended.
    * You can submit your application at any time, regardless of the current game&rsquo;s theme or status.
    * Applications are processed in batches, so you may not hear from us immediately. Please be patient!
1. Respond as quickly as you can to any additional inquiries we have during the confirmation process.
    * We will eventually need more information than we ask for initially, such as payout information.  
        <small>(We only maintain payout information for confirmed beneficiaries, not all applicants.)</small>
1. Inform your community via email, social media, and word-of-mouth that you are participating in Hacker Trivia Night when you are selected.
    * Hacker Trivia Night competitions are typically themed, so you will most likely be selected as a beneficiary in a group with similar types of beneficiaries.
1. Enlist champions to form teams to compete on your behalf.
    * Players must [declare their beneficiary]({% link faq/index.md %}#how-do-i-choose-who-my-winnings-will-go-to) when they register their teams.
    * You may also compete on your behalf!
1. Collect prize money after the game if any teams competing on your behalf have won.
    * The exact amount depends on the donations received from donors and the results of the game, of course.
