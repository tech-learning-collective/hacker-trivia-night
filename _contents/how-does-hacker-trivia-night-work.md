title: How does Hacker Trivia Night work?
---

1. Beneficiaries such as local businesses and non-profit groups register with us ahead of the game and encourage their constituents to form one or more teams to play on their behalf.
1. Good samaritans such as yourself, your friends, your neighbors, and others donate to create a prize pool that will go to support the beneficiaries. We use well-known crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe to keep donors updated and to help manage funds in a trusted, transparent manner.
1. Players register on our game website, which is an open source [Capture the Flag (CTF) gaming system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security), and optionally form teams. Each team must declare a beneficiary with the GMs to be able to claim their prize.
1. When the game starts, teammates work together to answer &ldquo;hacker trivia&rdquo; questions in the form of quizzes and puzzles that test the player&rsquo;s cybersecurity skillz. (Beginners are welcome and encouraged to play! You can&rsquo;t be l33t if you don&rsquo;t try!)
1. Teams compete to score points as quickly as possible by answering quizzes and completing puzzles faster than other teams. The team with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner and claims the grand prize for their chosen beneficiary.
1. Prize money from the pool of collected donations is divided among the top-performing teams and distributed to the declared beneficiaries.
