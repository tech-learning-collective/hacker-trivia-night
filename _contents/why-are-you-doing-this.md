title: Why are you doing this?

### The short version

We miss our local bars and clubs (and many others who are struggling), so we decided to do something about it. We made our own classic bar trivia game, hyperlinked in to the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Thus, **Hacker Trivia Night** was born!

### The long version

At both Tech Learning Collective and Shift-CTRL Space, our mission is to empower and educate community members and advocacy groups with knowledge of digital safety best practices, including cybersecurity preparedness, Internet privacy, and digital security.

Many people and local businesses are struggling to survive due to a combination of factors. The obvious and longstanding failures of federal, state, and municipal governments to fight back against murderous greed on the part of corporations and well-to-do property owners is high on this list of factors.

Bars, nightclubs, and other venues where we socialize and create community have been forced to close, leaving many in our immediate community without necessary social support structures. But even in bleak times like these, it&rsquo;s important to have some fun.

We wanted some way to have fun while simultaneously helping our friends and neighbors. Due to the global coronavirus pandemic, since we can no longer go out to their brick-and-mortar venues to see them, we figured we would find a way to invite them to join us at *our* venue: the Internet.

What better way to come together as a community while at the same time having fun and fulfilling our mission of empowering local community members with necessary cybersecurity knowledge and training?

**Hacker Trivia Night** is our latest attempt at punching above our weight. We&rsquo;re a small group of New York City residents who believe we can be a lot more than the sum of our parts if we work together to support those nearest and dearest to us: our fellow New Yorkers.
