Hacker Trivia Night is a joint project by [Tech Learning Collective](https://techlearningcollective.com/) and [Shift-CTRL Space](https://shiftctrl.space/), in partnership with numerous beneficiaries.

### Tech Learning Collective

**Tech Learning Collective** is an apprenticeship-based technology school for radical organizers headquartered in New York City that provides a security-first IT infrastructure curriculum to otherwise underserved communities and organizations advancing social justice causes.
