# Forestry Integration

[Forestry](https://forestry.io/) is a Content Management System (CMS) platform-as-a-service that provides a Web-based graphical user interface geared for content authors. Using a number of conventional [configuration files](https://forestry.io/docs/settings/config-files/) located in this folder, a developer can define the specific ways that an editor should interact with the Web site's content. This Jekyll Skeleton supports numerous Forestry integrations out-of-the-box.
