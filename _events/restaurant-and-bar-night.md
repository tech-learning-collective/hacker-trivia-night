Join us for our first Hacker Trivia Night supporting beneficiaries in the food (and drink) service industry!

One of the hardest-hit sectors of New York City&rsquo;s economy has been [bars and restaurants](https://www.businessinsider.com/nyc-restaurant-workers-coronavirus-unemployment-2020-3?op=1). Restaurants and bars have been forced to close due to the coronavirus pandemic, leaving hundreds of thousands if not millions of food service workers struggling to make rent.

For weeks on end, [New York&rsquo;s unemployment systems were down](https://gothamist.com/news/ny-unemployment-claims-applying-website-crashing), leaving workers unable to even file for benefits, much less actually receive them when they were needed. Although government officials have temporarily ceased evictions on paper, [many landlords have moved to evict tenants anyway](https://www.propublica.org/article/despite-federal-ban-landlords-are-still-moving-to-evict-people-during-the-pandemic). At the same time, property owners are receiving mortgage relief but [renters are still expected to pay rent](https://gothamist.com/news/cuomo-gives-ny-homeowners-coronavirus-mortgage-benefit-no-relief-renters-edge), revealing a clear double-standard where the rich see the most benefit from government at the expense of the poor and working class.

The workers we are talking about are not merely numbers on a labor statistics report. They are our friends. So we&rsquo;ve decided to debut Hacker Trivia Night as &ldquo;Restaurant and Bar Worker&rsquo;s Night&rdquo; and award collected donations to food service industry workers.
