        <h2>How does Hacker Trivia Night work?</h2>
        <div class="e-content">
            <ol>
                <li>Beneficiaries such as local businesses and non-profit groups register with us ahead of the game and encourage their constituents to form one or more teams to play on their behalf.</li>
                <li>Good samaritans such as yourself, your friends, your neighbors, and others donate to create a prize pool that will go to support the beneficiaries. We use well-known crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe to keep donors updated and to help manage funds in a trusted, transparent manner.</li>
                <li>Players register on our game website, which is an open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer_security">Capture the Flag (CTF) gaming system</a>, and optionally form teams. Each team must declare a beneficiary with the GMs to be able to claim their prize.</li>
                <li>When the game starts, teammates work together to answer &ldquo;hacker trivia&rdquo; questions in the form of quizzes and puzzles that test the player&rsquo;s cybersecurity skillz. (Beginners are welcome and encouraged to play! You can&rsquo;t be l33t if you don&rsquo;t try!)</li>
                <li>Teams compete to score points as quickly as possible by answering quizzes and completing puzzles faster than other teams. The team with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner and claims the grand prize for their chosen beneficiary.</li>
                <li>Prize money from the pool of collected donations is divided among the top-performing teams and distributed to the declared beneficiaries.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Gameplay is scored in real-time, and leaderboards show the current game state. <a href="{% link static/images/screencapture.gif %}">Watch a short demo to see what gameplay is like</a>.

        <h2>Why are you doing this?</h2>
        <div class="e-content">
            <h3>The short version</h3>
            <p>We miss our local bars and clubs, so we decided to do something about it. We made our own classic bar trivia game, hyperlinked in to the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Thus, <strong>Hacker Trivia Night</strong> was born!</p>
            <h3>The long version</h3>
            <p>At both Tech Learning Collective and Shift-CTRL Space, our mission is to empower and educate community members and advocacy groups with knowledge of digital safety best practices, including cybersecurity preparedness, Internet privacy, and digital security.</p>
            <p>Many people and local businesses are struggling to survive due to a combination of factors, with the failure of federal, state, and municipal governments to fight back against the murderous greed of corporations and well-to-do property owners being high on this list.</p>
            <p>Bars, nightclubs, and other venues where we socialize and create community have been forced to close, but even in dark times like these, it&rsquo;s important to have some fun.</p>
            <p>We wanted to help our neighbors and figured that since we couldn&rsquo;t go out to see them in their brick-and-mortar venues safely, we would find a way to invite them to play with us in the place we consider <em>our</em> home turf: the Internet.</p>

        <h2>Rules</h2>
        <div class="e-content">
            <p>
                Before you sign up, you need to know that <strong>we strictly enforce several lightweight <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Social-rules">social rules</a></strong>. In brief: racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, capitalist advocacy, &ldquo;brogrammer,&rdquo; &ldquo;manarchist,&rdquo; or any kind of similarly awful behavior will not be tolerated and you and your team will be immediately ejected from the game. This is judged at the sole discretion of the game organizer. Never take a learning opportunity away from another participant, no matter how smart you need everyone to think you are.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Searching for quiz answers on your phone during the game is <em>allowed</em>. If you don&rsquo;t know it, search for it!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        No attacking the game infrastructure. If bugs or vulnerabilities are found, please alert the game organizers immediately.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Absolutely no sabotaging of other teams, or in any way hindering their independent progress.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Violations of the <a href="https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Social-rules">social rules</a> by any player will result in that player&rsquo;s team forfeiting the game.
