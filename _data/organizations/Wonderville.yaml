    Wonderville is a bar, event space, and indie arcade located in Brooklyn, NY. Owners Mark Kleback and Stephanie Gross kickstarted the venue in May 2019 as a place for the indie video game community to congregate and showcase their work. Now approaching itâ€™s one-year anniversary, Wonderville has been forced to close due to the COVID19 outbreak. We hope to stay afloat during this crisis through donations and virtual events like Hacker Trivia!
