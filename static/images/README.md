# The `images` folder

This folder holds images you upload and publish on your Website. Each file you upload gets its own Web address (URL), so it can be referenced individually and shared with others. You can also use these images in various other places across your site, such as [the featured `image` for a blog post](../../_posts/README.md#image), by referencing either the full URL or just the image file's name.
