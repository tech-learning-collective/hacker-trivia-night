# The `_drafts` folder

This folder contains drafts of blog posts that you intend to [publish to your website's blog pages](../_posts/), but are not yet done working on or do not know when you would like the post to be published. Even though the draft will not be published on your website, it is still visible to everyone on the Internet if they look for it. You can use this to make sure that the phrasing of your post meets with the approval of everyone involved before the post is officially published to your website.

Refer to the [documentation of your website's `_posts` folder](../_posts/README.md) for more details about how to publish blog posts.
