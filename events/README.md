# The `events` folder

This folder contains templates for publishing calendar events. Unless you want to heavily customize your website, you should avoid changing anything in this folder. To publish new calendar events, add them as files in your [site's `_events/` folder](../_events/README.md) instead of editing the files in this folder.

The following list briefly describes some of the files in this folder and their purpose:

* `index.html` - Your site's main events page. A web page with details about all your site's events is generated by this template.
* `all.ics` - Your site's main digital calendar, published as an iCalendar feed. This template generates the file accessed by a visitor's digital calendaring application (like Google Calendar) when they subscribe to your site to receive alerts of events you post.
